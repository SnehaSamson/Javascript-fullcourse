What is Javascript?
 Javscript is a light weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.


 Variables in Javascript : 
 - Variables are the containers which stores the data.
 - We can store array, object, string, numbers.
 - This is Javascript can change a variable type in runtime.
 -This is called dynamically typed language.
 - Means you can change through run time the type of the variable.
 - Static type means need to declare which type of variable it is after that only you can perform any operation.
 - But in Javascript you can change the type of the vraibale in runtime also and you can also perform the required operations.

 Rules for choosing Variables :
 - letters, digits, underscore and $ sign are allowed.
 - Must begin with a $, _ or a letter.
 - Javacsript reserved words cannot be used a svariable name.
 - Javacsript variable names are case sensitive like sneha and Sneha both are different variable names.


 Difference between let, var and const :

 var : var is globally scoped while let and const are block scoped.
       var can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
       let can be updated but not re-declared.
       const can neither be updated nor be re-declared.

Primitive Datatypes and Objects : 
 - There are 7 primitive Datatypes
 - These are fundamental data types 

 Data type : means what data to be stored in a variable.
 Objects are non-primitive Datatypes.
 N - null
 N - numbers
 S - String
 S - Symbol
 B - Boolean
 B - BigInt
 U - undefined

If object is declared as const then you can add the key items to the object. Because by declaring a constant object it will be considered as a refernce variable.
- You can add the new key items to the object but you cannot add te new value to it like numbers or string.

Expressions and Conditionals : 
- A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.
- Every value written literally is an expression.
- ex : 77 or "Sneha".

Conditional Statements : 
Sometimes we might have to execute a block of code based on some Conditions.
- In javascript we have three forms of if else Statements
1. if Statement
2. if... else Statement
3. if... else... if ... else Statement.
